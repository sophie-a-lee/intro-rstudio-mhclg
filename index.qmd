# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the Introduction to Quantitative Analysis with R course, designed for and with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG). This course aims to introduce R and RStudio software. R is an open-source software that was designed to make data analysis more accessible, reproducible, and user friendly. 

This two-day course will equip you with the essential skills to leverage the power of R for your data analysis. We will begin with a gentle introduction to the RStudio interface and the basics of the R coding language (or syntax). We will then see how R can be used to efficiently load, clean and transform data. Finally, we will use R to produce clear, compelling visualisations and tables to communicate findings. 

Throughout the course, we will discuss best practices for reproducible data analysis, ensuring that all code adheres to the [Analysis Standards](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/intro.html) as recommended by the [Aqua book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-aqua-book-guidance-on-producing-quality-analysis-for-government).

## How to use these materials
This e-book provides a combination of written explanations, code examples, and practical exercises to allow you to practice what you have learned. 

```{r}
#| label: code-block-example
#| eval: false

1 + 1
```

Code within these blocks can be copied and pasted into your R session to save time when coding (I recommend typing the code yourself to familiarise yourself with the coding process and use the copy option if you are really stuck!). 

Throughout the materials, you will see colour-coded boxes which are used to highlight important points, give warnings, or give tips such as keyboard shortcuts.

:::{.callout-note}
These boxes will be used to highlight important messages, supplementing the main text.
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
## Hint

These boxes will contain useful hints, such as keyboard shortcuts, that can make your coding life a little easier!
:::

:::{.stylebox}

::::{.stylebox-header}
:::::{.stylebox-icon}
:::::
Style tip
::::

::::{.stylebox-body}
These boxes contain style tips to ensure that your code follows the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/), making it as consistent and readable as possible.
::::

:::

:::{.callout-warning}
These boxes will contain warnings and highlight areas where you need to be more cautious in your coding or analysis.

To make these notes as accessible as possible, they are available to view in dark mode by toggling the ![](img/dark_mode.png) button. They are also available to download as a PDF file using the ![](img/pdf.png) button.

All exercise solutions are available in the appendices. Please attempt the exercises yourself first, making full use of R's built in help files, [cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/) and example R code in this book. Going straight to the solutions to copy and paste the code without thinking will not help you after the course!

Some exercises contain expandable hints, such as functions required to complete them, that can be viewed when needed. For example:

:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Exercise hint

The functions you will need for this exercise are `filter` and `count`.

## Data for the course
This course uses data from the English Housing Survey (EHS) from 2021 and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) 2024 economic and fiscal outlook. All data used in the course can be downloaded from the [course repository](https://github.com/sophie-a-lee/introduction_rstudio_dluch/tree/main/data). 

Before beginning the course, please save these files into a folder called 'data' within the folder you will be working from during the course.
