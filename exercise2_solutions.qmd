# Exercise 2 solutions

## Question 1
Add your name and the date to the top of your script file (hint: comment this out so R does not try to run it)

## Solution {.unnumbered}
1. Add a `#` at the beginning of the row, followed by your name and the date, for example:

```{r}
#| label: ex2.1-sol
#| eval: false

# Sophie 18/11/2024
```

## Question 2
Use R to answer to following sums:

  a. $64^2$

  b. $3432 \div 8$

  c. $96 \times 72$
 
For each part of question 2, copy the result from the console and paste them onto the same line of the script file as the code. Do this in a way that ensures there are no error messages if you were to run the entire script file.

## Solution {.unnumbered}
For each calculation, copy the result from the console and paste it in the script file after a `#` symbol:

```{r}
#| label: ex2.2-sol
#| eval: false

64^2   # 4092

3432 / 8  # 429

96 * 72  # 6912
```
